# 5. Limit message history to 30000 messages per workspace in the free tier

Date: 2025-06-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

While the free tier is ample and practical for most open source projects, more critical projects must be allowed to benefit from a paid subscription. The free tier must be generous yet restricted in some way, so that critical projects have sufficient motivation to purchase the subscription.

## Decision

Limit the chat history of the platform to 30,000 messages per workspace in the free tier.

## Consequences

Critical projects will have sufficient motivation to purchase a subscription, contributing to Slouch Industries' revenue.
