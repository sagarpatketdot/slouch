# 1. The next-gen developer collaboration platform

Date: 2025-06-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

On a day-to-day basis, developers build features and fix issues by writing code. The more time spent on these activities, the more value is added. However, developers often track status across multiple third-party platforms to ensure that their code changes make it through the build and release pipeline. If any of the stages fail, they investigate and fix any issues. The core idea of Slouch, is to provide a collaboration platform for developers that bring such status updates to the developers, instead of them navigating through these platforms.

## Decision

Design and develop the next-generation developer collaboration pltaform.

## Consequences

Once configured, notifications inform developers of any failures in the build pipelines that require their attention.
